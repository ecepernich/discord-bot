Content Warnings
to add a warning: @rob-bot warn <keyword> 
(bot will reply with a confirmation message)
bot then scans every message for items from the list of all keywords. If found, it searches each user's personal lists and if it finds the keyword it adds them to the list of users that need warning. Then the bot sends a DM to every user on that list with the type of content as well as the channel.
